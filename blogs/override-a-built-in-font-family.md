> Can I use custom @font-face font with same name as built-in font?

> If the font family name is the same as a font family available in a given user's environment, it effectively hides the underlying font for documents that use the stylesheet. This permits a web author to freely choose font-family names without worrying about conflicts with font family names present in a given user's environment. Likewise, platform substitutions for a given font family name must not be used.
