用户代理（浏览器）样式声明、插件样式声明和网站作者样式声明的优先级：

1.  Declarations in user agent style sheets (e.g. the browser's default styles, used when no other styling is set).
2.  Normal declarations in user style sheets (custom styles set by a user).
3.  Normal declarations in author style sheets (these are the styles set by us, the web developers).
4.  Important declarations in author style sheets
5.  Important declarations in user style sheets
