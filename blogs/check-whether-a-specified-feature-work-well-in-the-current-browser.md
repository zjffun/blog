Sometimes, you may meet some bugs work well in almost all browsers, but weird in a specific browser, and want to check if it is a browser compatibility issue. You can use [wpt.live](https://wpt.live/) to do this.

For example, If you want to check whether the current browser handle custom elements attribute changed callback well, you can open <https://wpt.live/custom-elements/attribute-changed-callback.html> to text it.
